Cleeng for WordPress allows you to easily charge for your content by offering
a pay as you go solution for your site visitors.

== Description ==

Cleeng is a patented technical solution that brings innovation to content
monetization.

It enables website publishers, bloggers and other content creators to generate
micro payments and make (incremental) money from their creations. For visitors it simplifies
the access to unique quality content by offering a one-click, pay as you go
solution to online consumers. It works on web-enabled devices and for any kind
of online content and avoids the hassle of multiple subscriptions.

With the Cleeng for WordPress plugin you can start monetizing your content
within minutes. After installation of Cleeng and signing up as a publisher,
within the editor you can simply select the content you want to protect and click
the green button "Create Cleeng Content from Selection". You can define
the description and the price and after clicking save, two tags appear within
your editing field that mark your protected content. When you publish the
content the price and other references are saved on the Cleeng server (via
the Cleeng API). After publication visitors coming to your web-page will be
able to read and view the page normally, however part of the content is
protected. Now your visitors can with the one-click, pay as you go solution
instantly access this content.

Have a try: it really works this easy!
