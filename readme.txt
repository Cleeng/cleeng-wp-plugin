With Cleeng you can sell any individual piece of content directly from your own website. This complete 
plugin gives the options to sell your content or digital products in 3 different ways:

1. **Sell single items**,
2. Provide a **Daily pass(24h)**, or
3. Give access to all your content via membership **subscriptions** (weekly, monthly...)

**Cleeng supports USD, EUR and GBP**. You can price single items from 0.14 to 19.99 USD (or EUR / GBP). The plugin is free to use, and you can **keep up to 90% of all revenues generated** (starts at 80%). There are no hidden costs, all payment fees, user support, software maintenance is taken care of. You just need to create the right content that sells.

2- **For your users**, it is also made much easier so to boost your conversion rates:

* They don't need to register for every site they visit: Use Facebook, Google or Yahoo! once, and instantly login on any publisher website.
* All the content they buy is accessible from their Cleeng library: so if they start reading your blog on their office PC, and then want to keep reading on their mobile while commuting - Cleeng will make it happen.
* Integrated social-commissions: users share links on social networks, then they also get a chance to generate money. It's a win-win!
